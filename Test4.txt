*Introduction*


Moving
into
the
discussion
and
edit
pages
‘behind–the–scenes’
of

/Wikipedia/
reveals
a
complex
layering
of
debates
and
discussion

between
editors.
These
editors
can
be
identified
through
various

‘/Wikipedia/
awards’.
Focusing
on
the
/Wikipedia/
‘service
awards’,

this
paper
explores
the
disclosure
of
knowledge
as
it
is
intimately

bound
up
with
identity
work.


Disclosure
as
a
concept
helps
to
signal
how
knowledge
is
contributed

to
/Wikipedia/
in
ways
that
are
bound
up
with
identity
work.
Given

that
service
awards
are
‘intended
to
be
given
to
oneself’
rather

than
be
awarded
by
others,
they
point
to
the
investment
and
work

individuals
put
into
their
/Wikipedia/
profile
and
identity.
The

/Wikipedia/
awards
and
practices
of
knowledge
disclosure
provide

instructive
means
for
exploring
the
management
of
identity
and

context
specific
identity
work.

*/Wikipedia/
and
online
profiles*


Founded
in
2001,
/Wikipedia/,
as
the
‘About’
entry

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About)
states,
“is
written

collaboratively
by
an
international
(and
mostly
anonymous)
group
of

volunteers.”
The
entry
goes
on
to
state
that,
“/Wikipedia/
has
grown

rapidly
into
one
of
the
largest
reference
Web
sites,”
and
that

“there
are
more
than
75,000
active
contributors
working
on
more
than

13,000,000
articles
in
more
than
260
languages.”
The
following

considers
how
these
active
contributors
and
volunteers
are

positioned
and
identified
within
/Wikipedia/.


The
opportunity
to
edit
a
/Wikipedia/
entry
is
presented
with
each

page
and
can
be
taken
up
anonymously
without
logging
in.
This
kind

of
technologically
mediated
form
of
anonymity
resonates
with
debates

that
emerged
in
the
1990s
around
online
identities
(see
Turkle,

1995).
In
their
discussion
of
virtual
identities
in
wikis
and
social

networking
sites,
Kerry
Mallan
and
Natasha
Giardina
(2009)
suggest

that,
“while
the
‘identity’
of
an
individual
contributor
may
be

disguised,
unknown,
or
revealed,
there
is
nevertheless
a

‘wikidentity’
that
comes
with
participation,”
and
that
this

‘wikidentity’
is
“located
at
the
interface
of
diverse
bodies
of

information
and
communication.”
In
terms
of
/Wikipedia/,
the

contribution
or
disclosure
of
material
may
be
be
seen
as
a
part
of

the
wikidentity
construction
process.


The
term
‘disclosure’
appears
to
fit
easily
in
discussing
online

identity
and
different
degrees
of
anonymity
and
disguise.
This

reading
could
see
that
certain
identifying
characteristics
are
not

disclosed
and
a
form
of
anonymity
is
employed.
In
turn
though,

making
a
contribution
or
editing
an
existing
article
is
a
different

form
of
disclosure
—
a
knowledge
disclosure.
As
the
‘wikidentity’

concept
highlights,
questions
of
identity
in
online
contexts
can
be

traced
beyond
questions
of
anonymity
and
we
can
examine
specific

‘interfaces’.
Closely
focusing
attention
on
the
process
of

contributing
offers
a
means
to
connect
the
contributor
with
the

article.
In
this
respect,
/Wikipedia/
provides
a
context
and

interface
for
‘identity
work’.





++++++++++


*/Wikipedia/
and
identity
work*


Tony
Watson
[1
<#1>]
usefully
notes
that
the
phrase
‘identity
work’,

has
been
used
as
an
alternative
to
terms
including
‘identity

construction’,
‘identity
management’,
‘identity
achievement’,

‘identity
manufacture’
and
‘identity
project’,
“as
a
way
of
dealing

with
‘agency’
aspects
of
identity
shaping.”
In
developing
his
own

formulation
that
works
between
the
personal
and
the
social,
Watson

[2
<#2>]
suggests
that
a
significant
way
to
strengthen
research
on

identity
shaping
would
be
by,
“attending
to
what
might
be
seen
as
a

link
between
the
‘self’
aspects
of
identity
and
the
discourses
to

which
they
relate.”
With
/Wikipedia/
we
can
see
this
with
the

community
discussion
and
talk
pages,
and
with
the
personal,
and

sometimes
esoteric,
nature
of
contributions.


Practices
of
contributing
are
bound
up
with
all
manner
of
personal

traits,
experiences
and
motivations.
Jaron
Lanier
(2006)
is
cautious

of
conformist
collectivism
and
offers
the
following
perspective:

“reading
a
/Wikipedia/
entry
is
like
reading
the
Bible
closely.

There
are
faint
traces
of
the
voices
of
various
anonymous
authors

and
editors,
though
it
is
impossible
to
be
sure.”
Any
given

/Wikipedia/
entry
could
be
the
continual
work
and
investment
of
a

range
of
contributors.
/Wikipedia/
is
marked
by
ongoing
input;
from

the
contributor
who
starts
prolifically
and
then
whose
contributions

peter
out,
to
the
most
recent
newcomer
who
seeks
to
revise
years
of

contributions.
For
example,
the
first
entry
for
‘Web
2.0’
is

recorded
on
28
February
2005
at
20.17.
Since
then,
as
the
‘revision

statistics
history’
indicates,
there
have
been
thousands
of
edits

both
from
registered
users
and
those
unnamed
users
distinguished

only
by
IP
(Internet
Protocol)
addresses.


Contributing
and
editing
articles
to
/Wikipedia/
takes
place
in

dialogue
and
negotiation
with
other
users.
On
one
hand,

contributions
may
be
anonymous
and/or
ephemeral.
On
the
other
hand,

these
contributions
can
be
targeted
and
part
of
a
wider
process
of

contribution
and
participation.
Along
these
lines,
Mallan
and

Giardina
(2009)
suggest
that,
“claiming
individual
ownership
of

parts
of
a
wiki
runs
counter
to
the
way
wikis
operate.”


The
award
system
that
has
emerged
within
/Wikipedia/
highlights
that

forms
of
recognition
are
entwined
with
editorial
activities
and
that

these
can
be
both
part
of
and
distinct
from
the
wider
social

environment.
This
interpretation
connects
with
Tony
Watson’s
focus

on
the
‘inward’
and
‘outward’
aspects
of
identity
work.
Working

between
wider
discourses,
such
as
other
/Wikipedia/
contributors,

and
the
‘self’
is
an
important
step
in
exploring
the
disclosure
of

knowledge
and
claiming
of
awards
as
a
form
of
identity
work.

*/Wikipedia/
service
awards
and
knowledge
disclosure*


In
the
following,
different
award
systems
will
be
introduced
in

relation
to
social
and
private
forms
of
identity
work
and

management.
Before
doing
so,
some
important
methodological
points

are
needed.
Whilst
materiality
has
been
stressed
in
connecting
the

contributor
with
actual
postings
and
edits,
this
article
does
not

draw
on
empirical
research
with
any
of
these
contributors/editors.

Equally,
more
detailed
accounts
of
practices
and
frequencies
of

awarding
oneself
service
awards
have
not
been
gathered.
Rather,
my

aim
here
is
to
draw
out
what
the
concept
of
disclosure
helps
unpack

for
examining
online
identity
work.


In
exploring
the
contributions
made
to
/Wikipedia/
and
the
claiming,

giving
and
display
of
the
awards
for
a
/Wikipedia/
online
profile,

the
notion
of
disclosure
helps
signal
that
these
editorial

activities
are
a
strategy
of
identity
work
alongside
the
production

of
knowledge.


Knowledge
is
disclosed
as
part
of
a
wider
system
of
activity
and

meaning
bound
up
with
identity
work.
The
language
of
contributing

and
adding
indicates
that
knowledge
is
brought
to
/Wikipedia/.
The

language
of
disclosure
helps
to
signal
that
the
contributions
are

processed.
/Wikipedia/
is
the
context
and
site
within
which

information
may
be
added
and
revealed.


The
processing
work
of
disclosure
can
be
identified
in
terms
setting

up
an
account,
selecting
and
monitoring
topics
and
entries,

developing
materials
using
the
‘sandbox’,
and
then
posting.
Noting

these
stages,
the
language
and
process
of
disclosure
becomes
more

apt.
Further
to
this,
identity
work
takes
place
in
the
management
of

the
online
profile
and
the
claiming
and
display
of
services
awards.

The
claiming
of
certain
awards
represents
knowledge
management
bound

up
with
the
shaping
of
aspects
of
identity.


There
are
a
number
of
award
categories
within
/Wikipedia/
that
can

be
awarded
by
others
and
claimed
by
individuals
for
themselves.
Some

awards
are
for
topics
areas,
such
as
‘The
Music
Award’
or
‘The
Star

Trek
Award’.
Other
awards
are
given
for
general
contributions,
such

as
‘The
Mouldy
Sandwich’
that
is
awarded
for
those
continually

working
on
and
bettering
/Wikipedia/.
Further
to
these,
there
are

the
‘Personal
User
awards’,
“given
to
honor
specific
actions
or

events
—
or
to
spread
good
cheer!”
Out
of
the
range
of
awards,
some

are
more
clearly
focused
on
awarding
activities
and
roles
performed.


The
‘barnstar’
award
was
introduced
to
/Wikipedia/
in
December
2003

and
“since
then,
the
concept
has
become
ingrained
in
the
/Wikipedia/

culture
[…]
It
is
the
custom
to
reward
/Wikipedia/
contributors
for

hard
work
and
due
diligence
by
awarding
them
a
barnstar”
(Awards,
at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Awards).
Significant
to
these

given
awards
is
that
the
orginator
of
the
award
and
those
that
give

the
awards
are
also
recorded.
The
barnstar
award
then
is
explicitly

enmeshed
with
the
/Wikipedia/
community
(notwithstanding
the

possibility
of
an
editor
establishing
a
profile
to
give
awards
to

another
of
their
profiles).


In
contrast
to
the
‘barnstar’,
the
service
awards
on
/Wikipedia/,
as

made
clear
in
the
guidance,
are
“unlike
other
awards
given
through
a

process
or
from
one
editor
to
another
in
a
show
of
appreciation,
[…

and
are]
intended
to
be
given
to
yourself”
(awards).
Service
awards

are
organised
in
terms
of
a
hierarchy
from
‘novice
editor’
to

‘master
editor’.
However,
as
the
entry
for
the
awards
makes
clear,

they
are
a
“way
of
acknowledging
an
editor’s
level
of
contribution

based
on
specific
benchmarks,
including
the
number
of
contributions

the
editor
made
to
/Wikipedia/,
and
the
length
of
time
they
have

been
registered”
and
the
award
is
“achieved
strictly
by
a
mechanical

count
of
time
registered
and
number
of
edits.”
In
this
respect,
the

service
awards
are
a
means
in
which
a
contributor
to
/Wikipedia/
can

distinguish
their
profile
through
their
own
quantifiable
activities

removed
from
other
users.
It
is
a
part
of
their
online
profile
that

can
be
managed
and
developed.


As
Lee
Salter
(2006)
emphasizes
in
his
discussion
of
participatory

media,
the
“Internet
and
its
users
are
materially
embodied
entities

that
exist
in
politically
and
economically
regulated
space.”

Highlighting
the
materiality
of
/Wikipedia/
contributions
and
edits

alongside
the
claiming
of
service
awards
emphasizes
the
range
of

investments
and
forms
of
identity
work.


In
their
research
with
young
people
on
social
networking
sites

Mallan
and
Giardina
(2009)
suggest
that,
“young
people
are
not

simply
adapting
their
identity
work
to
fit
these
technological

applications.
Rather,
they
are
engaging
creatively
with
the

principles
of
Web
2.0
and
manipulating
identity
presentation

applications
to
suit
their
needs.”
I
would
echo
this
approach
to

technologically
mediated
identity
work
with
regard
to
/Wikipedia/

contributors/editors
who
develop
their
profile.
Sensitivity
may
be

identified
to
the
mechanics
and
context
of
/Wikipedia/,
and
that

their
knowledge
disclosures
connect
with
their
identity
work.
In

their
discussion
of
wikidentities,
Mallan
and
Giardina
(2009)

suggest,
“when
an
individual
or
group
constructs
an
online
profile,

the
resultant
‘identity’
gives
a
particular
interpretation
or

representation.”


In
the
claiming
and
displaying
of
service
awards,
we
could
say
that

individuals
are
constructing
and
managing
their
online
/Wikipedia/

profile.
As
Paul
du
Gay’s
(2007)
perspectives
on
the

cultural–material
making
up
of
persons
helps
raise,
this
is
not
to

say
that
knowledge
disclosure
be
reduced
to
identity
building.
What

does
emerge
though
is
/Wikipedia/
as
the
context
and
practical
means

through
which
knowledge
disclosure
can
be
connect
with
identity
work.





++++++++++


*/Wikipedia/
as
the
context
and
practical
means*


Du
Gay’s
approach
to
the
cultural–material
making
up
of
persons,

draws
attention
to
“both
the
contexts
within
which
and
the
practical

means
through
which
individuals
are
equipped
with
the
capacities
to

conduct
themselves
as
particular
sorts
of
persons”
[3
<#3>].

Adopting
this,
/Wikipedia/
provides
the
context
and
practical
means

for
identity
work
that
is
explicitly,
but
not
exclusively,
bound
up

with
knowledge
disclosure.
This
perspective
helps
situate
the

claiming
of
service
awards
in
relation
to
the
knowledge
disclosures

needed
to
achieve
the
awards.


Importantly,
du
Gay
(2007)
goes
on
to
stress
that
a
particular
form

of
personhood,
for
example
the
/Wikipedia/
contributor,
is
just
one

way
in
which
individuals
may
come
to
understand
and
relate
to

themselves.
The
claiming
and
displaying
of
the
service
award
may
be

seen
as
a
means
through
which
the
‘/Wikipedia/
contributor
identity’

is
constructed.
Each
contribution
or
article
edit
is
a
disclosure

that
can
be
measured
and
claimed
as
a
service
award
and
wedded
to

the
formation
and
development
of
a
/Wikipedia/
profile.


This
focus
on
knowledge
work
and
identity
work
that
the
notion
of

disclosure
helps
bring
to
the
fore,
poses
some
relevant
questions

for
thinking
through
questions
of
identity
and
online
profiles.
For

instance,
Mallan
and
Giardina’s
(2009)
statement
that,
“the

narratives
of
identity
and
agency
that
have
traditionally
been

available
to
young
people
are
being
replaced
by
new
ones
that
are

the
direct
outcome
of
the
larger
technologically
mediated
world
we

all
now
inhabit”,
can
be
rearticulated
in
relation
to
the
mediation

of
knowledge.
The
reference
to
‘young
people’
is
particular
to
their

study,
but
the
‘narratives
of
identity
and
agency’
they
refer
to
can

be
considered
through
the
lens
of
knowledge
and
identity
work
on

/Wikipedia/.
Narratives
of
identity
may
be
technologically
mediated,

but
practices
of
knowledge
production
are
also
technologically
mediated.


When
we
explore
the
connection
between
narratives
of
identity
and

knowledge
production,
a
much
fuller
understanding
of
identity
work

is
possible.
This
sees
identity
work
as
it
is
closely
connected
with

the
other
things
we
do
and
the
contexts
for
these,
for
example

editing
/Wikipedia/.
The
concept
of
disclosure
gets
at
these

multiple
processes
and
how
they
work
together
—
the
revealing
of

knowledge
and
building
and
revealing
of
identity.


/Wikipedia/
co–founder
Lawrence
Sanger
(2009)
suggests
that,

“despite
the
sort
of
anti–expert
bias
on
/Wikipedia/,
it
remains
the

case
that
a
person
who
appears
to
write
authoritatively,
who
has
the

facts
at
his
command
as
an
expert
typically
does,
and
who
can

marshall
them
effectively
in
a
dispute,
has
a
decided
advantage
on

/Wikipedia/.”
Beyond
discussing
expertise,
Sanger’s
(2009)
comments

help
highlight
the
process
of
knowledge
disclosure
(writing
style,

research)
and
that
this
has
material
impacts
on
the
interpretations

and
representations
of
that
contributor
that
can
form.
Service

awards
act
as
indicators
both
for
others
and
those
that
display

them.
These
service
awards
illustrate
a
form
of
identity
work
that

comes
with
contributing,
or
disclosing,
to
/Wikipedia/.





++++++++++


*Some
(ignorable)
qualifications*


In
March
2007,
it
was
revealed
that
the
contributor
with
the

username
‘Essjay’
was
not
a
professor
of
religion
at
a
private

university
as
claimed,
but
a
college
student
(BBC
News,
2007).
This

‘/Wikipedia/
Storm’
highlights
a
number
of
things
in
terms
of
the

disclosure
of
knowledge
and
identity.


Firstly,
related
to
Lawrence
Sanger’s
earlier
comments
on
expertise,

adopting
the
status
of
a
professor
for
this
college
student
clearly

indicates
the
purchase
of
certain
identifiers
such
as
title.


Secondly,
in
terms
of
fakery,
we
cannot
assume
the
merit
or
standing

of
particular
knowledge
disclosures.
Whilst
this
student
college

adopted
a
fabricated
identity,
they
still
endeavored,
with
the
help

of
the
For
Dummies
series,
to
provide
accurate
statements.
In
turn,

there
have
been
numerous
postings
to
/Wikipedia/
in
which
content

fakery
has
been
the
goal
—
(un)knowledge
disclosures.


The
article
‘Can
you
spot
the
real
/Wikipedia/
fake’
offers
a
number

of
purported
‘false
and
made
up
statements’
posted
by
‘mischievous

Internet
users’.
These
include
the
entry
for
‘Pole
Dancing’
as,

“Pole
dancing
is
a
form
of
dancing/gymnastics
that
takes
muscular

endurance
and
coordination
as
well
as
a
person
from
Poland”

(Supanet,
n.d.).
This
highlights
that
contributors
to
/Wikipedia/

may
not
seek
to
claim
‘service
awards’
and/or
participate
in
the

rewards
process,
and
also
that
contributors/editors
may
post

statements
in
ways
that
do
not
“augment
the
knowledge
held
by
the

/Wikipedia/
encyclopedia”
in
anticipated
and
encouraged
ways.


/Uncyclopedia/,
“an
encyclopedia
full
of
misinformation
and
utter

lies”,
goes
further
in
highlighting
and
celebrating
misinformation

on
the
Internet
and
the
posting
of
humorous
and
satirical
takes
on

topics,
such
as
the
‘Jennifer
Anniston
nude
pictures’
that
are
natal

scans.
As
the
‘Beginner’s
Guide’
states,
“we
are
not
/Wikipedia/,

but
that
should
already
have
been
plainly
obvious.
Fact
is

discouraged,
comedy
is
paramount”
(/Uncyclopedia/,
2006).

/Uncyclopedia/
tellingly
plays
on
the
conventions
of
/Wikipedia/
in

the
way
it
is
organised
and
presented,
and
the
through
the

distinctive
/Uncyclopedia/
approach
to
article
policy:
“a
standard

that
everyone
should
follow,
unless
they
don’t
want
to,
in
which

case
they
are
free
to
ignore
it”.


This
policy
‘guidance’
neatly
captures
the
community
ethos
played

off
against
the
free
reign
that
editors
are
encouraged
to
take
with

the
veracity
of
their
postings.
There
are
significant
aspects
of

dialogue
and
collaboration
such
as
the
‘Pee
review’
system,
but

unlike
/Wikipedia/
there
are
no
services
awards.
This
distinction

between
/Uncyclopedia/
and
/Wikipedia/
provides
an
instructive
final

point
for
considering
the
cultural
politics
of
knowledge
disclosure

and
identity
work.





++++++++++


*The
cultural
politics
of
knowledge
disclosure*


With
/Uncyclopedia/
we
can
identify
an
interest
and
enthusiasm
for

parody.
In
common
with
/Wikipedia/,
the
collaborative
and
community

elements
are
key
and
/Uncyclopedia/
stresses
the
importance
of

constructive
entries
rather
than
the
degenerative
editing
of
others.

/Uncyclopedia/
facilitates
the
recognition
of
articles
and
has
a

nominating
and
voting
process
to
highlight
articles.
Also,
similar

to
/Wikipedia/,
credit
is
given
in
the
form
of
awards
for
those
that

clean
up
and
make
/Uncyclopedia/
tidy
with
regard
to
its
editorial

policy
(and
comically
for
those
that
give
‘generic
contributions’,

take
doses
of
humiliation
and
come
back,
and
who
disregard
editing

conventions).
The
key
distinction
between
these
sites
though
are
the

service
awards.


This
distinction
emphasizes
the
specificity
of
the
context
and
that

the
forms
of
identity
work
possible
within
/Wikipedia/
are
bound
up

with
disclosures
that
can
garner
measurable
kudos
for
an
online

profile
in
the
‘serious’
business
of
editing
online
encyclopedias.





++++++++++


*Conclusion*


Online
communities
present
diverse
ways
for
users
to
undertake

identity
work.
The
/Wikipedia/
service
awards
with
the
self–claim

element
highlight
that
identity
work
is
rooted
in
the
structures
and

processes
of
the
context.
In
the
case
of
/Wikipedia/,
we
can

identify
structures
and
processes
of
knowledge
disclosure.
Identity

work
connects
with
technological
specificity,
and
personal
and

social
impulses.


By
examining
/Wikipedia/
contributions/edits
as
disclosures
rather

than
additions,
attention
may
be
drawn
to
processes
of
management

and
identity
work.
Here,
disclosure
is
understood
as
a
process
of

revealing
in
dialogue
with
context.
This
article
has
suggested
with

/Wikipedia/
the
disclosure
of
knowledge
is
entwined
with
the

building
and
revealing
of
identity.
